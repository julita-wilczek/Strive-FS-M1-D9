<!-- 
Create programmatically a bingo board with 76 cells, numbered from 1 to 76.
Create a button to randomize a number from 1 to 76. 
The cell with same number should be highlighted in some way on the bingo board.

EXTRA: 
- Make sure to always select a new number (eg. avoid getting the number 10 multiple times).
- Create a user board with 24 randomized numbers that highlights as the main board does.
- Let the user choose how many user boards he's willing to play with and 
   generate them before starting to play.
