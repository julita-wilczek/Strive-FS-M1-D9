Functionalities:
1. Bingo Board with 76 cells, numbered from 1 to 76, is created programmatically (using JS)
2. Click on a button to generate a number from 1 to 76. The cell with same number will be highlighted on the bingo board.
3. Every time a new number is selected is different from the ones before. 
4. User can generate a user board with 24 numbers that highlight as the main board does.
5. Let the user choose how many user boards he's willing to play with and generate them before starting to play.

FIXES NEEDED:
1. User numbers are not randomized
2. Each User board should be generated separately
